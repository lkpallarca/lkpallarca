# Lance Pallarca
Hi, I'm Lance!

:airplane: As an Aeronautical Engineer, I graduated from [PATTS College of Aeronautics](https://www.patts.edu.ph/) and took my OJT at [Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines](https://caap.gov.ph/). Having experienced the technical and governing side of aviation, I am always interested about the progress of the aviation industry as a whole and especially within the Philippines.

:computer: As a Software Developer, I graduated from the awesome bootcamp [Avion School](https://www.avionschool.com/). Having recently graduated, I am now focused on expanding my network and connecting with more people within the industry. Learning never stops and as a result, I am filled with purpose to strive for more.

Previously, I was a frontliner for the Local Government Unit of Para√±aque City. Before that, I worked as a Technical Support Representative for Alorica. 

## What I'm good at
- Cooperating and working with a team to bring the best out of each other
- Seeing the bigger picture and having a strong sense of goal and purpose when working on anything
- Managing and directing time and effort to be as efficient as possible to accomplish tasks
