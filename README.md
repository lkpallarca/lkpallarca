Hi, I'm Lance!

I am a Product Engineer at [First Circle](https://www.firstcircle.ph/). We specialize in building solutions to help SMEs grow.

:computer: As a Software Developer, I graduated from the bootcamp [Avion School](https://www.avionschool.com/). I got a glimpse of the possibilities of Full Stack Development and learned to expand my network and connect with more people within the industry. Learning never stops and as a result, I am filled with purpose to strive for more.

:airplane: As an Aeronautical Engineer, I graduated from [PATTS College of Aeronautics](https://www.patts.edu.ph/) and accomplished my OJT at [Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines](https://caap.gov.ph/). Having experienced the engineering and governing side of aviation, I am always interested about the progress of the aviation industry.
